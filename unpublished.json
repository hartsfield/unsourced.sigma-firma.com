Bless his heart, the man seems to stumble more often than a toddler learning to walk. Ron DeSantis, the self-proclaimed candidate extraordinaire, has proven time and time again that running for office might not be his strong suit. Join us as we take a humorous dive into the mishaps and missteps of the one and only Ron DeSantis.

Unfortunately for DeSantis, his attempts at witty comebacks fell flat like a pancake.

Let's just say, if likes and retweets were votes, DeSantis would be in desperate need of a recount. The Gaffe Machine: Ron DeSantis is known for his uncanny ability to deliver gaffes on a silver platter. From mistaking facts to inventing new words, his campaign speeches often sound like a game of  political Mad Libs.</p><p> Perhaps his most memorable slip-up was when he declared that he would \"build a wall around Florida to keep out the sun\" because it was causing too much heat. Sorry, Ron, but SPF 50 sunscreen might be a more reasonable solution. The Photo Op Fiasco: Photo opportunities are crucial for any candidate to connect with voters and demonstrate their relatability.

From his stumbling stage runs to his cringe-inducing gaffes, DeSantis has shown us that running for office might not be his calling.
